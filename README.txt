|## Inspiration                                                                                              |
|# General Idea                                                                                              |
|We were inspired by the Best Space App and Most Useless Hack awards to create a program that was space-     |
|themed and almost utterly useless while still making it completely functional at what it was meant to do. We|
|then brainstormed a bunch of space related questions that could be easily answered through a Google search  | 
|or through any other search engine. Many questions were thought of, most of them related to math and        |
|physics, but we settled on the question on how far we are from the moon depending on which continent we are |
|living on. This question could be easily looked up on the internet, allowed us creatively display this      |
|information, and could also be easily displayed to anyone with a computer. We also decided on the distance  |
|to the moon toremember the great moon landing accomplishment that brought much needed attention to the STEM |
|world.                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                            |
|# Design                                                                                                    |
|We knew from the start that making this program text-based through the terminal was the easiest way to match|
|the old, ancient computer aesthetic that we were looking for while also making it easily accessible to      |
|everyone. This aesthetic was to respect how far we've come in the advancement of computers and the plethora |
|of computer hardware and software improvements we have received. This chosen aesthetic also inspired ASCII  |
|diagrams to visualize the data we display in the program.                                                   |
|                                                                                                            |
|## What it does                                                                                             |
|Our program asks for your name and which continent do you live in. It takes this information and prints out |
|an ASCII style diagram where it plots the continent where you are at and prints out the average distance you|
|are from the moon in miles (sorry, but we don't use kilometres over here). It will also make a text file of |
|the ASCII diagram and distance statement, where the name of the text file is the name you inputted          |
|previously. The program will then ask if you want to run it again or quit out, and this can be rerun        |
|indefinitely until you decide to quit out of it.                                                            |
|                                                                                                            |
|## How we built it                                                                                          |
|This program was made completely out of Python! We made all of the ASCII art ourselves through a lot of time|
|and patience, and most of the code was made by taking the user inputs using if statements and while loops to|
|determine which method gets called to print the correct diagram. We also used a file reader and writer to   |
|write the files after each execution of the program.                                                        |
|                                                                                                            |
|## Challenges we ran into                                                                                   |
|Since this was our first collaborative project, learning how to use Git and Github to the fullest extent was|
|a very big learning curve for the both of us. It was also very difficult to settle on a definitive final    |
|product since we were always constantly wondering what parts of the project idea could get changed, and that|
|led to long periods of time in which no work would get done. Learning how to draw in ASCII format was also a|
|challenge that just required a lot of patience. This did not help that the both of us also had other work   |
|and deadlines to watch out for, which decreased the amount of time we could work on this project during this|
|hackathon. However, after all of these challenges have been conquered, we both had a blast making this      |
|project in a short amount of time and really enjoy the result that we ended up with.                        |
|                                                                                                            |
|## Accomplishments                                                                                          |
|We are very proud of the result that we ended up with given our time restraints. The ASCII aesthetic in     |
|particular was something we are both very proud on since it ended up surpassing both of our expectations on |
|how it would look. We were also able to rid of any potential bugs, so this program should run completely bug|
|free as long as you have access to the terminal and Python3.                                                |
|                                                                                                            |
|## What we learned                                                                                          |
|We learned how to use Git, Github, and the terminal properly and how to work collaboratively on projects. We|
|also learned the work behind ASCII diagrams and really the amount of patience you actually need to hard code|
|it by hand. We also learned about file readers and writers and how they could be implemented to print out   |
|text files.                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                            |
|## What's next for Lunar Line                                                                               |
|We hope to expand this program to cover other stars and planets in space so that you can get your average   |
|distance from the continent you are living in. Check back soon for further updates!                         |
